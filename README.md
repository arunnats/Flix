Flix is a movie recommender app which utilizes the MovieLens database to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. The app employs a collaborative filtering technique, leveraging a correlation matrix derived from user ratings. It selects the top-rated movies and those with a substantial number of reviews to build a correlation matrix, which forms the backbone of the recommendation engine.

## Machine Learning and Python 

The recommendation engine's machine learning model is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as numPy, MathPlotLib, Seaborn, and SciKit-Learn. Python is  used for the data analysis tasks, including building correlation matrices and exporting them as pkls for further processing.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The app retrieves movie data from the MovieLens database, including user ratings and movie information.
2. **Correlation Matrix Generation**: It constructs a correlation matrix based on user ratings, focusing on highly-rated movies and those with a significant number of reviews.
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Using the correlation matrix, the app generates movie recommendations tailored to each user's preferences.
4. **Live Search**: Users can search for movies in real-time using the live search feature, which fetches results dynamically as the user types.
5. **Data Visualization**: The app visualizes movie data using various graphs and charts, providing users with insights into movie ratings, genres, and other relevant metrics.
